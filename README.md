# Visualizing GitHub Organizations by Country to Assess Programming Community Growth

## 1. Description
The github-api-orgs-visualization project aims to analyze and visualize the distribution of GitHub organizations across various countries using the GitHub API.

As a software developer from Ghana, I recognized the need to understand the programming community's landscape to enhance local development. This project collects real-time data on GitHub organizations in different countries, including Ghana, to identify areas for growth and improvement in programming education and support within the local tech ecosystem.

Key features of this project include:

Real-time Data Collection: Utilizing the GitHub API to fetch the number of organizations by country.
Interactive Visualizations: Creating engaging bar charts using Plotly to effectively present the data.
Insightful Analysis: Highlighting Ghana's position relative to other countries, emphasizing the need for improved programming education and support.
This repository serves as a valuable resource for developers, educators, and stakeholders interested in assessing and fostering the growth of programming communities worldwide.
